# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 0 Example
# Constants
# Instruction:
# Define a constant for the value of pi and the number of
# hours in a day.
# =========================================================

"""
CONSTANT PI = 3.14
CONSTANT HOURS_IN_A_DAY = 24
"""

PI = 3.14
HOURS_IN_A_DAY = 24

# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 1
# Skills:
# - Algorithmic problem solving
# - Selection
# - Boolean logic
# Instruction:
# Write a FUNCTION that takes a number and returns
# whether it is a valid exam mark (between 0 and 100 inclusive).
# The function must return a BOOLEAN value.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 2
# Skills:
# - Loop reasoning
# - Accumulator
# Instruction:
# Write a FUNCTION that calculates and returns the
# average of a list of integers.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 3
# Skills:
# - Arrays
# - Searching
# - Flags
# Instruction:
# Write a FUNCTION that searches for a target value
# in a list and returns TRUE if found, FALSE otherwise
# and stops as soon as the value is found.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 4
# Skills:
# - Loop control
# - Multiplicity
# - Dictionary
# Instruction:
# Write a FUNCTION that goes through a list and
# counts how many times each value appears,
# returning a dictionary mapping each value to its count.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 5
# Skills:
# - Input validation
# - Condition-controlled loop
# Instruction:
# Write a FUNCTION that repeatedly asks for a number
# until it is strictly positive, then returns it.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 6
# Skills:
# - Nested selection
# - Classification logic
# Instruction:
# Write a FUNCTION that converts a numeric mark
# into a grade: A (>=80), B (>=60), C (>=40), F otherwise.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 7
# Skills:
# - Modular decomposition
# - Function reuse
# Instruction:
# Using the Grade FUNCTION, write a PROCEDURE that
# prints the grade for each mark in a list.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 8
# Skills:
# - Algorithm tracing
# - Correct loop bounds
# Instruction:
# Write a FUNCTION that returns the largest value
# in a non-empty list of integers.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 9
# Skills:
# - Defensive programming
# - Boolean logic
# Instruction:
# Write a FUNCTION that checks whether a password
# is valid: at least 8 characters and contains a digit.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 10
# Skills:
# - Pseudocode fidelity
# - Algorithm implementation
# Instruction:
# Implement the following algorithm exactly:
# Count how many values in a list are strictly above the average.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 11
# Skills:
# - Guided implementation
# - Abstract data types
# Instruction:
# Implement a STACK using a list.
# A stack is a data structure that follows LIFO (last in, first out) logic.
# It need two METHODS: Push to add an item to the top,
# and Pop to remove and return the top item.
# =========================================================



# =========================================================
# PROBLEM 12
# Skills:
# - Guided implementation
# - Queue (FIFO logic)
# Instruction:
# Implement a QUEUE using a list.
# A queue is a data structure that follows FIFO (first in, first out) logic.
# It need two METHODS: Enqueue to add an item to the back,
# and Dequeue to remove and return the front item.
# =========================================================
